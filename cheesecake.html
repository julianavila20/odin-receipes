    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>This is a classic New York-style cheesecake with a graham cracker crust and
         high sides. It is rich, dense, and light at the same time, and serves a small army.
        But watch out! Just when you think you've made 
        enough for your gathering, so many people will go back for seconds that you 
        may be left without a piece!</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds (900g) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>  (270g) sugar </li>
        <li> Pinch salt </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 4 large eggs, at room temperature </li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup (160ml) heavy cream </li> 

    </ul>
    

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Beat cream cheese, then add sugar and beat:
        Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an 
        electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium 
        speed for 4 
        minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar and beat
         for 4 minutes more.</li>

     <li> Add salt, vanilla, then eggs, then sour cream:
        Add the salt and vanilla, mixing just until incorporated. Add the 
        eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed for 30 seconds after each 
        addition. Remember to scrape down the sides of the bowl, and scrape up any
         thicker bits of cream cheese that have stuck to the bottom of the mixer that 
         paddle attachment has failed to incorporate.
        
        Add the sour cream and mix on medium speed until incorporated.  </li>

     <li>Add the heavy cream:
        Add the heavy cream and mix on low speed until incorporated.</li>
</ol>
