    <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according
     to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle 
     a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together. </li>

     <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, 
     breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and 
     add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 
     Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through. </li>

     <li>
        Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan,
         parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and 
         season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
